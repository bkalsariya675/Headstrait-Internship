            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.

            CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
            It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.
            CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

<!-- In todays task I learned about video and audio tags along with JS event on it(onmousehover, onclick, onkeyup)
Secondly got to know how the CSS hierarchy works,
got to know about the triple equal operator(===),
also about the (+=) operator in JS in which how the class appends,
different positions in CSS,
basics of media query and its flow,
By Using Universal Selector we can assign margin, padding, etc to all.

row and column class in css
difference between width and max-width(suppose ek div ko 500 width and ek div ko 500 max width diya hai, 
then jab webpage 500 width se kum kiya so max width wala will adjust it according to the size of brwoser page whereas 
width wala will go out of current webpage size and creates a horizontal scrollbar at the bottom )

Flexbox lines up things in one direction whereas Grid has the ability to line things up in two directions(always)
(suppose there are finite number of images in a row and some text is written on the images we can do this thing only
with the help of grid because it allow us to overlap things which flex does not) 

flex-wrap: It defines whether the flex items are forced in a single line or can be flowed into multiple lines.

The flex-wrap property accepts 3 different values:

nowrap (default): single-line which may cause the container to overflow
wrap: multi-lines, direction is defined by flex-direction
wrap-reverse: multi-lines, opposite to direction defined by flex-direction
